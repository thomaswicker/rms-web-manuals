                <h3 class="title">The Editor Window<br />
                </h3>
                <p>Clicking on the Editor button on
                  the upper right portion of the Sinfonia® Player window will take you to
                  the Editor. From here, you can customize your own version of the show.</p>
                <h4 class="title">The Main Editor Screen</h4>
                <p>The main Editor screen may be thought of in two parts.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The top line of fields and buttons is the information and
                    navigation center. From here you can identify and select which show
                    and/or song you want to edit. You can identify the currently active
                    Edit window. You can save your work and exit the Editor.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Current Show</b> - The top left field shows the currently
                      active show. Your editing will only affect this show. If multiple
                      versions of a particular show have been created, you can select one of
                      your alternate versions by clicking on the arrow to the right of the
                      field. NOTE: Sinfonia® considers Acts as individual shows. You will
                      only see the various versions of the currently active show (i.e. Act).
                      See “Loading A New Show” or “Edit Show List” for instructions on
                      switching acts.</li>
                    <li><b>Current Song</b> – Underneath the Current Show field is
                      the
                      Current Song field. This indicates the song that is ready to be edited.
                      Clicking on the arrow to the right of the field will display all the
                      available songs in the show. You can then click on a new song title for
                      editing.</li>
                    <li><b>Save</b> – Click this button to save your work. If no
                      changes have been made (and therefore no work to be saved), it will be
                      grayed-out and inactive. If you have made changes, this button will be highlighted green. We recommend saving often, especially if you are making large amounts of edits!</li>
                    <li><b>Player</b> – Click this button to exit the Editor and
                      return
                      to the Sinfonia® Player. NOTE: You can only exit from the ‘Main’ Editor
                      screen. If you have entered one of the sub-consoles (i.e. Muting,
                      Transpose, etc.), you must first exit the sub-console and return to the
                      Main screen.</li>
                    <li><b>Quit</b> – Click this button to quit out of Sinfonia®</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Underneath the main information console, occupying the majority
                    of the
                    screen, are several tabs. Clicking these tabs will take you to the
                    various sub-consoles where specific editing tasks are accomplished.<br />
                  </li>

                <p>If you plan on doing any editing, it’s a good idea to save multiple
                  versions of your show. This way, if there’s a problem or you make a
                  mistake, you can easily return to a previous or alternate version.</p>
                <p>The Shows Console is where you can copy, delete, and rename shows
                  listed in the master show list.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Clicking “New” will generate a fresh copy of the original show
                    data. These new files will not contain edits and will reflect the shows
                    as they were originally shipped.</li>
                  <li>Click “Save Copy As” to create a copy of the selected show. Any
                    edits present in the selected show will be reflected in this new show.</li>
                  <li>“Rename Show” allows you to rename an existing show.</li>
                  <li>Clicking “Delete” will delete the selected show.</li>
                  <li>“New Default Show” is where you can select which show will load
                    when you return to the Player. See “Loading A New Show” for details.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>When naming shows, please limit your titles to 14 characters or
                  less
                  and use only letters and numbers. Don’t use any spaces, punctuation
                  marks or other non-alphanumeric characters.</b></p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>New</b> – This button allows you to add a song from any
                    existing
                    show. With this button, you could, for example put some incidental
                    music from Act 2 into Act 1. Any new songs will be placed at the end of
                    the song list of the currently active show.</li>
                  <li><b>Copy</b> – This button allows you to duplicate the selected
                    song. Any
                    edits that exist in the selected song will also be copied. The copy
                    will be placed immediately following the source song.</li>
                  <li><b>Rename</b> – This button allows you to rename the selected
                    song. When
                    renaming, please use contiguous alphanumeric characters.</li>
                  <li><b>Delete</b> – This will delete the selected song. Keep in mind you can always put a song that you have deleted back in by using the &quot;New&quot; button (though you may need to create a clean copy of the current act to load the song from).</li>
                  <li><b>Move Up/Down</b> – The selected song will move incrementally
                    in the
                    selected direction.</li>
                  <li><b>Transpose</b> – This button allows you to transpose the
                    selected song
                    up or down in half step increments. See Transpose Edits for more
                    details.</li>

                <p>If a song is too high or low for a particular performer, the
                  Transpose Edit Window allows you to change the key easily. To transpose
                  a song:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>From the Songs Tab, select the song you wish to transpose.</li>
                  <li>Click on the Transpose button.</li>
                  <li>Click the up or or down arrows to raise or lower your song choice.</li>
                  <li>Each increment represents a half step.</li>
                  <li>Click <b>Exit</b><br />
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>These transpositions are intelligent. Non-pitched interments and
                  other instrumental lines that are not meant to be transposed will be
                  unaffected by Transpose Edits.</p>
                <p>These transpositions will affect the entire a song. If you want to
                  transpose just a portion of a song, you may do so in the <a href="advanced.html">Actions Tab</a> described later in the manual. </p>

                <p>The Mute Tab will take you to the muting sub-console.</p>
                <p>You will want to customize Sinfonia® to mute any instruments that
                  are
                  being performed by traditional instruments. This way, Sinfonia® only
                  covers the parts that are not present in your usual ensemble. You can
                  mute instruments on a show basis, on a song basis or even for just a
                  small portion of a song. You can also unmute instruments that may have
                  been previously muted. All these tasks can be accomplished in the Mute
                  sub-console.</p>
                <br />
                <p>When you enter the Mute sub-console, you will see a large box with a
                  list of all the instruments scored in the show. Next to each instrument
                  is a <b><i>Show Mute</i></b> box and a <b><i>Song Mute</i></b> box.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>To mute an instrument for the entire show, click on the
                    instrument’s corresponding Show Mute check box.</li>
                  <li>To mute an instrument for an individual song:</li>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Make sure your desired song is in the Current Song field.</li>
                    <li>Click on the instrument’s corresponding Song Mute check box.<br />
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </ul>
                <table width="500" class="figure">
                  <tr>
                    <td align="center" valign="bottom"><p class="caption">Mute Edit Console</p></td>
                  </tr>

                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p>There are times when it makes sense to mute and unmute instruments
                  for just a portion of a song. For example, if you are performing a
                  musical with four reed books, but you only have two reed players, you
                  would probably show-mute Reeds 1 and 2 in Sinfonia® and give these
                  parts to your acoustic players. However, there might be a 16 bar
                  section of one song where there is a particularly interesting phrase
                  written for Reeds 3 &amp; 4, while Reeds 1 &amp; 2 are tacit. You might
                  then want to move your acoustic players to the Reed 3 &amp; 4 books
                  just for that section.</p>
                <p>The easiest way to accomplish this is through the <b>Section Mute</b> window. Section muting is convenient because it allows you to specify a
                  duration that your muting or unmuting will last; in so doing, it
                  automatically performs the step of re-muting or re-unmuting the
                  instrument at the end of the duration. Section Mute also allows you to
                  perform similar mutes or unmutes on a group of instruments. So to take
                  the example above, you can mute Reeds 3 &amp; 4 together from measures
                  10 to 27 in one fell swoop.</p>
                <p>To accomplish a Section Mute, do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>From the Mute Tab, click on the Section Mute button. </li>
                  <p>This will take you to the Section Mute Select window.</p>
                  <li>Select the instrument(s) you wish to mute or unmute.</li>
                  <p>You can select multiple instruments if you want.</p>
                  <li>Click Continue</li>
                  <p>This will take you to the Section Mute Edit window (See Figure 8 -
                    Section Mute Edit Window). The instruments you selected, as well as
                    their current mute status, will appear in the main central box.</p>
                  <li>Click New</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Select either either Mute or Unmute from the pop-up menu, depending on what you want to do.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Type the start measure number for your mute/unmute.</li>
                  <p>Be sure to enter a number that actually exists for the song in
                    question. If it’s a lettered measure, use a corresponding decimal point
                    for the letter (i.e. a = 0.1; 12b = 12.2)</p>
                  <li>Hit [tab] on your typewriter keyboard.</li>
                  <p>The cursor will advance to the next field.</p>
                  <li>Type the starting beat for your mute/unmute.</li>
                  <p>Again be sure to enter a beat that makes sense. Don’t type beat 4 if you are working in a piece that is in 3/4 time.</p>
                  <li>Hit <tab> on your typewriter keyboard.</tab></li>
                  <p>The cursor will advance to the next field.</p>
                  <li>Type the end measure number.</li>
                  <p>As before, be sure to enter a number that actually exists for the
                    song in question. If it’s a lettered measure, use a corresponding
                    decimal point for the letter (i.e. 9c = 9.3; 36d = 36.4).</p>
                  <li>Hit [tab] on your typewriter keyboard.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Type the end beat number.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>Click [Okay]</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li>At this point, the mute/unmute you are creating will appear in the
                    central Section Mute box display. If you are satisfied with it, click
                    on the Section Mute Exit button at the bottom right portion of the
                    screen.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This will return you to the Section Mute Select window, where you
                  can choose additional instruments for different mutes/unmutes or click

                <p>The Volume Edit module allows you to apply a percentage adjustment
                  to individual instruments on either a show or song basis. To edit
                  specific songs, be sure the song in question is selected in the top
                  ‘Current Song’ field.</p>
                <p>Note: Volumes settings live within a range of 0-127. Therefore,
                  there are limits to the amount you can increase volume. For example, if
                  an instrument is preprogrammed at a volume level of 100, the most you
                  will be able to increase it is 27% to get to the maximum value of 127.
                  Attempting an increase greater than 27%, in this case, will still
                  result in just a 27% boost, since the setting has already reached its
                  upper limit. Generally speaking, volume adjustments should be kept
                  within a 15-20% range. If you feel you need a very large gain, consider
                  lowering the other instruments instead, so the instrument in question
                  stands out more.</p>

                    With repeats and vamps, the ‘From Measure’ is the start of the repeated
                    or vamped section of music. With cuts, the ‘From Measure’ is the

                    want the music to play. That is to say – if you want a section of music
                    to play twice, you would want it to repeat once (# of Times = 1). If

                <p>Sinfonia® is performed by playing the beat or rhythmic subdivision
                  of the song. When music is initially crafted for Sinfonia®, choices are
                  made as to what are logical and organic rhythms to use to drive the
                  tempo. For example, we may assign a quarter note play for a brisk
                  walking tempo; dotted quarter play for a fast 6/8 march; eight note
                  play for a particularly expressive rubato melody, or a swing pattern
                  for a swing number. Furthermore the play assignment might change within
                  a song as its character changes. (These assignments are noted in the
                  Sinfonia score for the show you are producing as well as in the Play
                  field of the Player window.)</p>
                <p>However, these choices are subjective. The Sinfonia® player might
                  prefer to play quarters in a place where we’ve programmed eighths, etc.
                  You can customize the way you perform Sinfonia® in the Rhythm window.</p>
                <p>To add a new Play subdivision change:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Click the Rhythm button</strong><br />
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Click New</strong><br />
                    The various beat subdivision and pattern options will appear in a
                    pup-up menu within the resulting Rhythm Item window. </li>
                  <li><strong>Select your desired beat or pattern subdivision.</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Enter the measure where you want the new play subdivision to take
                    effect.</strong><br />
                    As always, the measure number must actually exist within the
                    score. Translate lettered measures into their decimal equivalent (i.e.
                    12c = 12.3).</li>
                  <li><strong>Hit [OK]</strong><br />
                    Your new play subdivision will appear in the central display box.
                    At this point, you can add additional play subdivision changes. You can
                    change existing items by highlighting them, clicking on Edit Selection,
                    and following the above process.</li>
                  <p>You can delete items by highlighting your choice and clicking
                    Delete Selection.</p>
                </ol>
                <p>Note: in the Rhythm field, pattern subdivisions are often
                  abbreviated (eight note=E, quarter note=Q, etc.) Here are some common
                  patterns with their full explanations so you may acquaint yourself with
                  how the abbreviations work:</p>
                <p>E-Q-E = eight note, quarter note, eight note (a two-beat pattern)</p>
                <p>2E-Q = two eight notes followed by a quarter note (also a two-beat
                  pattern)</p>
                <p>Etrip = eighth note triplets</p>
                <p>HtE = half note tied to an eight note (note that this takes up two
                  and a half beats; in 4/4 time, the next pattern entered should be dQ
                  (dotted quarter) to fill the measure out.</p>
                <br />
                <p>dE swing = the swing/shuffle rhythm formed when a notated
                  dotted-eight + sixteenth note pattern (dE-S) is intended to be played
                  “swung” (like if they were part of a tuplet.)</p>
                <p>Note: to enter play or pattern subdivisions at a point other than
                  the downbeat of a measure, use the ADVANCED EDITING window described
                  later in this manual.</p>
                <p><font color="red">WARNING!</font> Do not attempt to delete the first
                  (topmost) rhythm event in the central display box (assigned to measure
                  1 or whatever the first measure of the song is.) If you do, an error
                  message will appear when you return to the player window and you will
                  be taken back to the editor window to remedy this. If you want to change the first rhythm event to something else, do so by &quot;editing&quot; this event.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Sinfonia® is meant to be played by a musician following the
                  conductor or stage action in real time. Nevertheless, there may be
                  occasions where you need to have Sinfonia® (as opposed to the player)
                  control the tempo. For this purpose, there are tempos preprogrammed
                  into most shows. Sinfonia® references these tempos if you enter <b><i>Go</i></b> or <b><i>Cruise</i></b> mode without otherwise establishing a tempo with
                  the <b><i>Play</i></b> keys. <b><i>A Tempo</i></b> also references them; hitting <b><i>A Tempo</i></b> makes Sinfonia® snap to
                  the preprogrammed values. Note: During normal playing, <b><i>Play</i></b> mode will
                  override any programmed settings. But if it is necessary to put
                  Sinfonia® on automatic pilot, and you want to modify the tempos, use
                  the Tempo Editor.</p>
                <br />
                <p><u>Editing Existing Tempos</u></p>
                <p>To edit specific song tempos, do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Start by making sure the song in question is selected in the top
                    ‘Current Song’ field.</li>
                  <li>Click the [Tempo] button in the Actions Tab.<br />
                    This will take you to the Tempo Editor console. In the large
                    window, you will see the existing programmed tempo(s) for the song. You
                    might get a warning that a Sinfonia® tempo map does not yet exist for
                    the selected song. If this happens, simply click “OK” to generate a new
                    map.</li>
                  <li>Either double click inside a specific field, or single click
                    inside a field and then click the [Edit] button.<br />
                    If you modify the location (Measure:Beat:Tick values) for a tempo,
                    make sure the location actually exists within the score. Note: there
                    are 480 ticks in a Quarter note. If you use the [Edit] button to modify
                    location, be sure to enter values for Measure, Beat, and Tick and to
                    separate these values with colons (i.e. <b>3:1:0, 12:2:240</b>)</li>
                  <li>If necessary, adjust the duration value by clicking inside the
                    gray box. This brings up a pop- up menu from which you can select a
                    rhythmic durational value.</li>
                  <li>If you have edited a Tempo with the [Edit] button, click [Finish]
                    to dismiss the dialog box. If you have edited a value after
                    double-clicking on its respective field, simply hit [Enter] on the
                    typewriter keyboard to confirm the change.</li>
                  <li>There is an [Undo/Redo] button at the bottom of the screen if you
                    need to back out of a step.</li>
                  <li>When you are done editing, click the [Save] button to save your
                    work.</li>
                  <li>Click [Exit] to return to the Main Editor screen.<br />
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p><u>Creating New Tempos</u><br />
                </p>
                <p>The process is similar for adding new Tempo events. Go to the
                  Tempo Editor console, click the [New] button, and proceed from Step 3
                  above as if you had hit the [Edit] button. Remember to follow the
                  Measure:Beat:Tick format when locating the Tempo (i.e. <b>3:1:0,
                  12:2:240</b>). Also, remember that the Tempo needs to be placed at a
                  location that actually exists in the score. If you want, you can click
                  the “Show All Measures” checkbox to see a full list of the selected
                  song’s measure numbers. Sinfonia® refers to lettered measures by a
                  decimal equivalent. So for example, suppose a song starts with three
                  pick-up measures before measure 1 – and these measures are called A, B
                  and C. If you want to put a new Tempo at the start of the second
                  measure, you would place it at <b>0.2:1:0</b>.</p>
                <p><u>Scaling Tempos</u><br />
                </p>
                <p>It’s possible to get a song that may have a great number of Tempo
                  events spanning a short period of time – say, over a few measures. This
                  generally happens when a ritard or an accelerando has been
                  pre-programmed. If you want to change the speed of many adjacent Tempo
                  events, it could be a bit tedious to edit each individually. Therefore
                  we have provided a scaling option, which allows you to apply a
                  percentage adjustment to a range of tempo events. To take advantage of
                  this, do the following from the Tempo Editor:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>In any column, click and drag until all the Tempos you want to
                    change are highlighted.</li>
                  <p>You will only see the highlight in the column in which you clicked
                    and dragged. Also, while you will see a box around all the events you
                    have selected, the last one will just have an outline, while the rest
                    will be shaded.</p>
                  <li>Type the desired scale value in the <b>Scale</b> box.<br />
                  </li>
                  <p>A value of 100 means you are scaling at 100% of the current value
                    – in other words, no change. So for example, if you want to make things
                    10% faster, you would enter a Scale value of 110%</p>
                  <li>Hit [Enter] or [Return] on the typewriter keyboard.</li>
                  <p>You will notice all the Tempo values change accordingly in the
                    selected region. The value in the Scale box will return to 100 –
                    representing the new 100%.</p>
                </ol>
                <p>(Of course, the way to get the best ritardando, accelerando or any
                  flexible, nuanced performance, is to play this music live with the Play
                  keys.)</p>
                <p>At any time, you can click the [Revert] button to revert to the
                  original Tempo map that came with the system. This action cannot be
                  undone.</p>
                <p><big><font color="red">Warning!</font></big> Be VERY CAREFUL when
                  doing tempo edits. Failing to follow the protocols above (such as
                  forgetting a colon or putting in an incorrect value in the measure,
                  beat or tick fields) may result in a corrupted, non-functioning tempo
                  file.</p>
                <p><font color="magenta">One final note:</font> Any changes made to a
                  song’s tempo file will affect all shows that reference that song. Thus,
                  the tempos you set for “Tomorrow” in your show file “MyAnnie1” will
                  appear in the show file “Annie1” (or any other show which contains that
                  song.)<br />
