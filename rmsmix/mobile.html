            <div class="entry">
              <p>RMS Mix® is designed specifically for ease of use. The interface is streamlined to give you the simplest method of playing your show, while still allowing for more complex editing if you have the need. (Please note that editing a show requires the use of either Sinfonia® or RMS Coach® software.)</p>
              <p>By offering the full power of RMS Mix® in a portable app, the mobile version of RMS Mix® allows you easily take full tracks for your shows wherever you go!</p>
              <h3 class="title"><a name="unlocking" id="unlocking"></a>Trial vs. Full version              </h3>
              <p>The trial version is a fully featured application that allows you to experiment with how RMS Mix® works. By default, the trial version of RMS Mix® (mobile) comes with the overture from &quot;Carmen&quot; pre-loaded, so you can experiment with the program without the need to load a specific show.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-mainwin.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="mainwin" /></p>
              <p>The full version of RMS Mix® is only available to individuals and organizations that have acquired the license for a specific show through the appropriate licensing organization (MTI, R&amp;H, etc). In order to purchase the unlock code for the full version, you will need to license the production through the licensing organization.  The license will run for a particular length of time, depending upon the arrangement you have made with the licensing organization. At the end of your license, RMS Mix® will notify you that your license has expired.</p>
              <p>Note: there is no limit to the time you can use RMS Mix® before your performances. So provided you have a valid performance license, you could rehearse with RMS Mix® for as long as you are likely to need it. A few weeks, a month, a year – it's up to you.</p>
              <h3 class="title"><a name="purchasing" id="purchasing"></a>Purchasing the Full Version</h3>
              <p>Use of the full version of RMS Mix® (mobile) is included with purchase of the desktop version. You must install RMS Mix® (desktop) in order to unlock RMS Mix® (moblie). For instructions on purchasing, please <a href="desktop.html#purchasing">click here.</a>              </p>
              <p>To download, simply search for &quot;RMS Mix&quot; in the App store (or Google Play Store for Android users).</p>
              <h4 class="title"><a name="authentication" id="authentication"></a>Authentication</h4>
              <p>To gain full use of RMS Mix®, you will need to link the app to your specific production. This is done by use of a QR code (or your order number, if you have it).</p>
              <p>To authenticate:</p>
              <p>1. First, tap on the icon with music notes along the top of the window. This takes you into the show management window of RMS Mix®. </p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-auth1.png" width="500" height="281" alt="auth1" /></p>
              <p>2. Now click on the '+' icon in the upper right to add new content.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-auth2.png" width="500" height="279" alt="auth2" /></p>
              <p>3. Fill out your name and email address and tap the next arrow to proceed.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-auth3.png" width="500" height="280" alt="auth3" /></p>
              <p>5. In order to see your production's content and authenticate RMS Mix®, you will need to either scan or import a picture of the QR image provided to the primary user (Note: Scanning a QR code is only available on iOS. Android users will have to import the QR image).</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-auth4.png" width="500" height="279" alt="auth4" /></p>
<p>6. If you don't have a QR image, you can instead use the order number for your production. Continue by choosing 'tap here if you don't have QR' along the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>7. Enter your production's order number (This will either be 'SNF' or 'CCH' followed by a six digit numeric code)</p>
<p><img src="images/mss-auth5.png" width="500" height="280" alt="auth5" /></p>
<p>If you have entered the correct code, you can now view and download the content specific to your production! Please note that content downloads may be large and it is recommended to download over WIFI and not mobile data connections.</p>
<h4 class="title"><a name="expirationoflicense" id="expirationoflicense"></a>Expiration of License</h4>
              <p>The license for a particular show is time based.  If you attempt to launch RMS Mix® after this period, you will be notified of this with a dialogue box.</p>
              <p>If you wish to extend the length of the license, or feel that there is a mistake, then please call us at 212-620-0774 and we will be happy to assist you.</p>
              <h3 class="title"><a name="getshowdata" id="getshowdata"></a>Show Management</h3>
              <p>By tapping on the music note icon you will enter the show management screen</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-showmanage.PNG" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></p>
              <p>This lets you switch between different show exports you have saved on your device. Simply enter the folder corresponding to your show, and you can select which file to load.</p>
              <p>If you would like to delete a show folder, tap and hold on the folder icon and then tap on the &quot;x&quot; icon that appears. Note that the default show &quot;Carmen&quot; can not be deleted.</p>
              <p>If you would like to delete a showfile within the folder, navigate into the folder and swipe left on the name of the show. A &quot;remove&quot; button will appear.</p>
              <h4 class="title"><a name="loading" id="loading"></a>Loading from RMS Coach® and Sinfonia®</h4>
<p>To download show data that you have exported from Coach® or Sinfonia®, you use the same process as detailed in the <a href="#authentication">Authentication</a> section of this manual.</p>
<p>Please note that full show exports can be quite large, so downloading may take awhile!</p>
<p>If you get an error screen stating that no content is found, please check that you have entered the correct import type and order number.              </p>
<p>There is also a catalogue of pre-programmed &quot;by the book&quot; commercial titles available. For more information, please contact Realtime Music Solutions at (212) 620-0774 or by going to our <a href="http://www.rms.biz/contact/">Contact</a> page.</p>
<h3 class="title"><a name="Interface" id="Interface"></a>Interface</h3>
              <p>There are 3 main screens for RMS Mix® (mobile). To switch between them, either tap on the arrow icon in the upper left to select a specific screen, or tap on the stack icon in the upper right to cycle through screens.</p>
<p><img src="images/mss-navbutton.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="navbutton" /></p>
              <h4 class="title"><a name="navigation" id="navigation"></a>Navigation Screen</h4>
              <p>The navigation screen is broken into a few subsections, allowing you quick and easy access to your entire show with just a few taps.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-mainwin.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="navscreen" /></p>
              <h5>Song List</h5>
              <p>On the left is the list of all the songs in your show, in performance order. You can select specific songs by tapping on the title.</p>
              <h5>Marker List</h5>
              <p>On the right side of the navigation window is a list of markers for the currently selected song. By tapping on a marker, you will immediately jump to that part of the song. You can also see the approximate placement of markers within a song as red lines within the timeline.</p>
              <p>Tip - you can jump to a marker while the song is already playing, in real time. Use this functionality to handle events like a &quot;jump cut&quot;, or for a situation where a singer has missed an entrance and you need to re-start the current section.</p>
              <h5>Customizing the marker list</h5>
              <p>By default, markers are pre-programmed for all RMS Mix® shows. However, if you have a license for RMS Coach® or Sinfonia®, you can use either of those programs to modify and create your own markers for the show. For more information please see the relevant sections in either of the <a href="http://www.realtimemusicsolutions.com/webmanuals/rmscoach/interfaceediting.html#markers">RMS Coach®</a> or <a href="http://www.realtimemusicsolutions.com/webmanuals/sinfonia2/interfaceediting.html#markers">Sinfonia® manuals</a>.</p>
              <p>Note that for repeated sections of music, RMS Mix® will append a suffix to any markers contained within. For example, a marker named &quot;Vocal&quot; inside a section of music that plays 3 times will be called &quot;Vocal.1&quot;, &quot;Vocal.2&quot; and &quot;Vocal.3&quot; respectively.</p>
              <h5>Transport<br />
              </h5>
              <p><img src="images/mss-transport.PNG" width="500" height="74" alt="transport" /></p>
              <p>The transport bar is found along the top. From left to right, the buttons have the following functionality:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>toggle metronome</li>
                <li>rewind to beginning of song / previous song</li>
                <li>rewind by one measure</li>
                <li>play</li>
                <li>stop</li>
                <li>fast forward by one measure</li>
                <li>fast forward to next song</li>
                <li>exit vamp</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Metronome</h5>
              <p>RMS Mix® has a metronome feature to assist in your learning and rehearsal process. When you toggle the metronome on using the button on the transport, it will activate both an audio as well as a fullscreen visual click. To adjust the volume settings for the click, or disable the visual click, go to the output settings for RMS Mix® by double-tapping on the knob icon under the master fader on the Output Mixer page, and <a href="#clickpref">following the instructions below.</a></p>
              <h5>Vamping</h5>
              <p>RMS Mix® has built in capabilities to handle vamping within songs. Whenever RMS Mix® comes across a section of a song pre-designated as a vamp, the &quot;Exit vamp&quot; button will highlight like this:</p>
              <p><img src="images/ss-exitvamp-highlight.png" width="73" height="73" alt="vamp" /></p>
              <p>This tells you that RMS Mix® is now within a vamp, and will keep repeating that section of music indefinitely until you press the &quot;exit vamp&quot; button. Once pressed, the program will finish its current playthrough of the vamp and proceed to the next section of music.</p>
              <p>If you would like a vamp to be programmed to play a specific number of times on every playthrough, simply tap-and-hold on the vamp icon when it is lit up for that particular vamp. Select the number of times you would like it to play and Mix® will use that for all future playthroughs.</p>
              <p><img src="images/ss-setvamp.png" width="96" height="225" alt="setvamp" /></p>
              <p>To return the vamp to default behavior, select the infinity symbol at the top of the list.</p>
<h5>Info icon</h5>
              <p>Tapping on the &quot;i&quot; icon will temporarily bring up information on the current song, including name, and playback location.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-info.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="info" /></p>
              <h4 class="title">&nbsp;</h4>
              <h4 class="title"><a name="parts" id="parts"></a>Parts Mixer              </h4>
              <p>The parts mixer is the second major screen for RMS Mix® (mobile). In it you will find channel strips for predefined groups of instruments for your current show. A standard parts mixer might include the following families: Reeds, Brass, High Strings, Low Strings, Percussion, Keyboards, Guitar, Other. </p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-instruments.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="parts" /></p>
              <p>This allows you to easily adjust the overall mix of your show without needing to micro-manage each individual instrument.              </p>
              <p>The main slider controls the overall volume of that grouping. Below that is a knob and text box for panning left/right.</p>
              <h5>Customizing instrument groupings</h5>
              <p>RMS Mix® comes with pre-programmed instrument groupings for each show, but if you have a license for Sinfonia®, you can specify your own instrument groupings. For more information, please see the <a href="http://www.realtimemusicsolutions.com/webmanuals/sinfonia2/customization.html#rmsmix">relevant section within the Sinfonia® manual</a>.</p>
              <h4 class="title"><a name="output" id="output"></a>Output Mixer</h4>
              <p>The third major screen for RMS Mix® (mobile) is the Output Mixer. This gives you control for the overall output level of the application, as well as reverb.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-outputmixer.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="outputmixer" /></p>
              <p>The master fader on the right control the overall sound output level of RMS Mix®. Please note that this is independent of your device's volume controls.</p>
              <h5>Channel Settings and Preferences</h5>
              <p>By double tapping on the knob icons on the bottom of each strip, you can enter a screen which allows for fine control of the settings.</p>
<p><img src="images/mss-channelstrip.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="channelstrip" /></p>
              <p>The controls for the channel strip correspond to overall volume for that channel, as well as reverb &quot;send&quot;.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-masterpref.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="masterpref" /></p>
              <p>The master strip settings allow you to control the overall level for the application. There are secondary pages for controlling both the reverb settings of the app, as well as the click.</p>
              <p><img src="images/mss-reverbpref.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="reverbpref" /></p>
              <p>Underneath the &quot;Reverb&quot; page, you can control the level and color of the reverb used by the application.</p>
              <p><a name="clickpref" id="clickpref"></a><img src="images/mss-clickpref.PNG" width="500" height="333" alt="clickpref" /></p>
              <p>Under the &quot;Click&quot; page, you can adjust the volume of the click by decibals (dB).  If you set the volume to &quot;off&quot; but have the click activated, you will still be able to see the fullscreen visual click. You also have the option to disable the visual click.</p>
              <p>If the &quot;countoff&quot; selection is enabled, then the click will play for a full measure before RMS Mix® start playback.</p>
